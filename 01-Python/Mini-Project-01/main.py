# âž” Ask the user to enter a command "add","sub","mult","div"
# and two # numbers to simulate a calculator.
# All of your functions are in a separate script calc.py
# Your main code is in main.py

from calc import *

# session status
session = True

# start the program

    operation = input("Select operation (add/sub/mult/div): ")
    num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))

    if(operation == "add"):
        result = add(num1, num2)
    elif(operation == "sub"):
        result = sub(num1, num2)
    elif(operation == "mult"):
        result = mult(num1, num2)
    elif(operation == "div"):
        result = div(num1, num2)
